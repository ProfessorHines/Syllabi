##Course Description and Prerequisites
The purpose of this course is to enhance your ability to be an informed critic of **American foreign policy (AFP)**, _the means by which the United States pursues its interests or ends aboard._  The course's central argument is that while the U.S. remains the world's greatest power, it is an increasingly embattled and exhausted power due to internal and external limitations on its capacity. To support this thesis, the courses builds a toolkit of knowledge about AFP by examining the historical and theoretical context of AFP, evaluating some of its historical successes and failures, and identifying the major problems currently confronting AFP. This includes the understanding that:

- Foreign policy is about making choices, considering costs, building coalitions at home and aboard, and evaluating past performances.
- Many disagreements about AFP result from fundamentally different assumptions about the nature and structure of world politics.
- America has its own national style or pattern of thoughts and actions that influences its foreign policy decisionmaking.
- Domestic politics and public opinion form a baseline that influences how foreign policy decisionmakers define foreign policy goals and interact with each other.
- The Constitution creates a structure of checks and balances between Congress and the President that do not always lead to an effective and efficient AFP.
- Foreign policy decision-making is often irrational, but there are good models of the process that allow us to explain, describe, predict, and evaluate it.
- There is as much disagreement about the means of foreign policy — diplomacy, economic statecraft, and military action  — as there is about it ends.

**Prerequisites and required skills** : To enroll, students must have junior or senior standing. This class has one prerequisite course (PSCI 230) and requires students to have a working knowledge of international relations theory. Prerequisite skills include the ability to work in small groups.

## Course Philosophy, Class Pedagogy, and Learning Objectives

Learning is more than memorizing facts and answering questions on a test. It is the process of enhancing your ability to use information to understand of how things work and how to make them better.This course will enhance your ability to:

 1. Ask the right questions
 2. Frame good problems.
 3. Acquire information.
 4. Evaluate sources of information.
 5. Critically investigate & solve problems.
 6. Make choices among alternatives.
 7. Explain abstract ideas to others.
 8. Generalize to new situations.

### Pedagogy

The structure of this course is influenced by a taxonomy of cognitive skills developed by Benjamin Bloom. He identified six steps to the learning process students must complete to master a subject and organized them into a pyramid (see figure below) to show how more complex skills developed on a foundation of simpler ones. In this course, students will focus on remembering and understanding concepts outside of class, while in-class time will be focused on the application of concepts.

### Learning Objectives

Bloom translated his taxonomy into discrete and measurable actions called learning objectives, which are statements that start with an action (verb) associated with the intended cognitive skill and end with an object that describes the knowledge students are expected to acquire or construct. Learning objectives have been developed for each topic based in this course and are the basis for all instruction and assessment.

### Student Responsibilities

This learning philosophy imposes upon students the responsibility 
1. Review the learning objectives for each topic.
2. Complete all assigned readings and exercises before class.
3. Ask the professor for assistance if they difficulty with specific learning objectives.
4. Attend class regularly, but only when they are fully prepared to participate.
5. Complete all course assignments by their deadlines (Late work is not accepted).
6. Review all feedback from the instructor, including feedback posted online.
7. Ask for clarification if instructions or feedback are not fully understood.
8. Finish the class (University policy on incompletes will be strictly enforced).
9. Inform the instructor beforehand if they cannot fulfill these responsibilities.

## Class Policies

### Academic Misconduct

All students must practice academic honesty. Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or disciplinary sanction by the University. All students need to be familiar with the Student Conduct Code, which is available for review online at: [http://life.umt.edu/VPSA/name/StudentConductCode](http://life.umt.edu/VPSA/name/StudentConductCode).

### Accessibility and Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction by supporting collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. If you have a disability that requires an accommodation, please present the instructor with a letter from [Disability Services for Students](http://life.umt.edu/dss/) (DSS), Lommasson Center 154 (243-2243), indicating the existence of a disability and suggested accommodations.

The instructor as attempted to make all course material accessible. If you find course material that has barriers to accessibility, please notify the instructor as soon as possible so the oversight can be corrected as quickly as possible..

## Course Requirements (% of Final Grade)

The following paragraphs outline the requirements for this course. Detailed information on each can be found on Moodle.

**Midterm: 9/11 Analysis and Online Exam (25%).** The midterm in this class is divided into two parts. After reading the _The 9/11 Report,_ students will write a 5-page midterm paper analyzing the process and structure of decision-making in AFP. Students will also complete an online midterm exam that asks five randomly selected questions based on the learning objectives listed on Moodle.

**Policy Memo and Library Research Assignment (5****%).** This preparatory assignment that models the research practices needed when writing policy memos.

**Learning Group Policy Memos and Presentations (40%).** Students will be assigned randomly to learning groups of 3-4 students to work on five problems related to AFP. For each problem, groups must (1) define a specific policy problem to address and (2) write a policy memo recommending a solution to the problem. Twice during the semester, groups will also give a seven minute presentation on their problem/solution. Groups will share their grade for each policy memo and presentation, but individual grades will be adjusted using an online peer evaluation. Groups will also submit learning issues and problem statements to the instructor. They will not be graded, but incomplete or late submissions will result in a one-letter grade penalty applied to the policy memo grade.

**Policy Presentations Worksheets (5%).** At the end of each set of presentations, all students will submit a presentation worksheet in which they identify the recommended policies, indicate if they accept or reject the recommendation, and indicate the reason for their decision. The worksheet is due at the end of class.

Final Paper and Final Exam (25%). The final in this class is divided into two parts: a traditional bluebook essay exam and individual policy briefing outlining recommendations to the President on the content of a new National Security Strategy.

## Grading

Grades are based on a 1000 pt. scale with points.

>**Grading Scale** 
>A = 1000-930, A- = 929-900, B+ = 870-899, B = 830-869, B- = 800-829, C+ = 770-799, C = 730-769, C- = 700-729, D+ = 670-699, D = 630-669, D- = 600-639, F = <600.

**Peer Evaluations.** After each group assignment, students will complete an online peer evaluation awarding a share of the final product to each group member besides themselves. Students earning a higher or lower average share will have their grade adjusted. Students must complete their peer evaluations to receive credit for the policy memo being evaluated. Full details are available online.
